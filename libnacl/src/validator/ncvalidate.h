/* Defines the API to the native client validation code.
 *
 * Note that the API is designed to use the NACL_SUBARCH_NAME
 * macro. This macro encapsulates the target architecture the
 * code is being compiled for into the name of the function.
 * This lets the API call different functions based on the
 * target architecture the code is being compiled for. It also allows
 * the maintainers of the compiled libraries to change the implementation
 * without having to update the API callers.
 *
 * The macro NACL_SUBARCH_NAME(name, arch, subarch) prepends "NaCl_"
 * to the function name, and suffixes it with the architecture and
 * corresponding subarchitecture (with underscores separating it).
 * Hence, for example, NACL_SUBARCH_NAME(ApplyValidator, x86, 64)
 * would generate the function name NaCL_ApplyValidator_x86_64.
