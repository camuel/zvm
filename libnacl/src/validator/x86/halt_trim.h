 * Parameters are:
 *   mbase - The beging of the memory segment to decode.
 *   vbase - The (virtual) base address of the memory segment.
 *   alignment - The blocksize alignment used for the code segment.
 *   sz - The number of bytes in the memory segment. Updated to new
 *        appropriate new value if trimming occurs.
 *   limit - The address one byte past the last byte in the memory to
 *        be validdated. Updated to appropriate new value if trimming
 *        occurs.
