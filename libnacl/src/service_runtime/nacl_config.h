 * HALT instructions (esp if there are none) as immediate data (or
 * something similar), cause the PC to go outside of the untrusted
 * code space, possibly into data memory.  By requiring 32 bytes of
 * space to fill with HALT instructions, we (attempt to) ensure that
 * such op-code absorption cannot happen, and at least one of these
 * HALTs will cause the untrusted thread to abort, and take down the
