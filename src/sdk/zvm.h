/*
 * UNDER CONSTRUCTION! MAY CHANGE. MAY CONTAIN ERRORS.
 * ZeroVM manifest header. contain the structure of user side manifest.
 * nexe can access this object via arguments as usual, e.g:
 * main(int argc, char **argv). argv[0] will contain the manifest if
 * strlen(argv[0]) == 0
 * it would be handy to cast argv[0] to Manifest:
 * struct Manifest *manifest = (struct Manifest*) *argv;
 *
 * 2011-11-30
 * update: "struct Manifest" has been changed. everything given to nexe
 * now has plain text format (in a future can be changed to json), so user
 * program must parse text part of manifest to obtain given keys/values
 *
 * 2011-12-01
 * update: now it is recommended to use api functions instead of using manifest
 * directly. now user can request changes in policy, there is, however, no garantee
 * that zvm will accept user settings. in case zvm accepted at least one of user's
 * hint it returns a new manifest.
 *
 * 2011-12-04
 * text user manifest removed. instead of it user can use UserSetup object.
 *
 * 2011-12-11
 * SystemList and Report structures removed. zvm onering wrappers updated.
 * SetupList structure updated with syscallback to support a new engine (see
 * "syscall overloading" in progress.txt
 *
 * 2011-11-20
